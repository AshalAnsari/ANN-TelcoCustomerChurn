# ANN-TelcoCustomerChurn
Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Includes data preprocessing, baseline models, deep learning implementation with Keras, handling class imbalance, evaluation with Precision/Recall, and explainable AI with SHAP for feature importance.

## Project Overview

### This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave the company) using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The solution covers:

✅ Data preprocessing (categorical + numerical features)

✅ Baseline Logistic Regression vs. Deep Learning (ANN in Keras)

✅ Handling class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights)

✅ Model evaluation with Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC

✅ Explainability using SHAP to identify key drivers of churn
